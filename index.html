          This website is a partial reconstruction of my previous site at www.hccc.org.uk which is
          no longer operational. For many years (2006 to 2018), that was self hosted on a DEC MicroVAX 3100/95
          running VAX/VMS and the WASD web server, but more recently it has been held on a commercial service in the U.K. This is a much
          reduced version following my decision to give up the hccc.org.uk domain name, mostly because I no
          longer live in the U.K., so it isn't appropriate anymore.

          One of the very few mentions of the previous website that I've ever seen described it as "eclectic",
          so ... that is it's new name!

          Most of the topics here will be on retro-computing (large scale computers rather than micro or
          home computers) and electronics.

          The previous website was not in any way a blog (I'm not sure any blogging software would run under
          VAX/VMS), and this one will not be either. It is just plain HTML, often with elements that were
          probably "deprecated" decades ago ... although there will also be quite a bit of glTF based 3D
          content.

          This site is very much under construction. It probably will be for as long as it exists, but it really
          is early days at the moment. More will be added in the weeks to come. Many of the subjects
          are pretty esoteric and are likely to be of very limited interest. But you never know -
          there might be something useful or of interest to <em>you</em>. 
          As everyone knows, there is <em>so much</em> "stuff" out there on the Web. Vast ... overwhelming ... 
          endless ... &#128515; There
          doesn't seem much point in repeating any of it, so only "unusual" things are here, for the most part.
          More bizarre than unusual in some cases, perhaps!
          These pages try to stick to technical things of some substance (hopefully).

        <h2>Retro-computing</h2>
        
        <h3>3D visualisation of a CDC Cyber 170-865 machine room</h3>

        This is a sort of interactive virtual museum exhibit built using Blender, glTF, glTF Transform and Babylon.js.
        It is intended to be an adjunct to the Nostalgic Computing Center (NCC) fork of DtCyber. It shows a CDC Cyber 170-865 machine room as
        it might have appeared somewhere in the period 1984 to 1990.
        <br><br>
        Clicking on the following link will open the visualisation in a new tab:
        <a href="cyber170-865-room/room-1-cyber-865.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC Cyber 170-865 Machine Room 3D interactive visualisation.</a>
        <br><br>
        For more information on this visualisation and how to interact with it, click <a href="room-1-cyber-865-info.html">here.</a>

        <h3> Photo-realistic still renderings of the Cyber 170-865 machine room equipment </h3>

        Some path traced renderings of some of the items in the Cyber machine room can be found by clicking
        <a href="photo_real_gallery.html">here</a>.
        These were rendered by Blender from the same models used to create the glTF representations.

        <h2>Electronics</h2>
 
        <a href="SonyICFRepair/sonyicfrepair.html"><h3>Repairing a Sony ICF-SW100 Radio</h3></a>
        Pre 1997 ones <i>will</i> die of broken ribbon cables. It is inevitable.
        Repair kits seem to be no
        longer available. Desperate times call for desperate measures...
