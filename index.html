    This website is a partial reconstruction of my previous site at www.hccc.org.uk which is
    no longer operational. For many years (2006 to 2018), that was self hosted on a DEC MicroVAX 3100/95
    running VAX/VMS, but more recently it has been held on a commercial service in the U.K. This is a much
    reduced version following my decision to give up the hccc.org.uk domain name, mostly because I no
    longer live in the U.K., so it isn't appropriate anymore.

    One of the very few mentions of the previous website that I've ever seen described it as "eclectic",
    so ...

    Most of the topics here will be on retro-computing (large scale computers rather than micro or
    home computers) and electronics.

    The previous website was not in any way a blog (I'm not sure any blogging software would run under
    VAX/VMS), and this one will not be either. It is just plain HTML, often with elements that were
    probably "deprecated" decades ago ... although there will also be quite a bit of glTF based 3D
    content.
