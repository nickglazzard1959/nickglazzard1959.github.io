<H1>Fun and Games Aligning and Servicing a Revox A77 (Dolby B Version)</H1>
<A NAME="august_-_october_2007"> </A>
<H2>August - October 2007</H2>

<P>I've owned a 1973 vintage Revox A77 (a standard speed, 4 track, Mark 3 with Dolby B) since 1986, when I bought it for &pound;300 from a musical instrument shop called "Tune Inn" in Hither Green (South London). That shop is still there and now has a web site: <A HREF="http://www.tuneinn.co.uk">http://www.tuneinn.co.uk</A></P>

<P>I don't think (in retrospect) that this A77 was in very good condition - the heads were
worn and the rotating tape guide made a fearful noise when rewinding tape. But I'd wanted
a Revox A77 since I saw one at school. That must have been about 1970 and I was 11 years
old. The quality of the thing was obvious, though, even at that age.  So once I'd seen
this one in the shop, I had to buy it!
</P>

<HR>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="RevoxA77Portrait.jpg">
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>I used it for recording off the radio on and off, but it never sounded as good as I
hoped it would (not suprisingly). Eventually, in 1997, I had some money to spare and I saw
an advertisement offering Revox servicing in the back of "HiFi News and Record Review". So
-
off it went for what I hoped would be a comprehensive renovation.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, that didn't turn out too well ... Everything started off fine - new
heads
were fitted and all the worn mechanical parts were replaced. Then there was silence for
about 3 months ... I think the person doing the work had some sort of personal crisis.
Eventually, I managed to get in touch with him, paid him and got the machine back. He'd
done a lot of work on it, and mechanically it was now sound. But it still didn't sound all
that good and there were definitely electrical problems (audible distortion on one channel
and I strongly suspected that it hadn't been set up properly - or at all).</P>


<P>Due to pressure of work, not much happened until 2003, when I fixed the distortion
problem (by replacing one of the transistors in the input amplifier). It now sounded a lot
better - but still not as good as I thought it should.</P>


<P>Over the years, I'd built up a collection of Hewlett-Packard and Tektronix test gear
(thanks mostly to E-Bay) and, having all the necessary equipment to hand, I finally made
some time to sort the A77 out once and for all. Or so I hoped ... (I was also prompted by
the arrival of audible distortion on the channel I hadn't fixed before!)</P>


<P>"Sorting it out" turned out to be a rather long winded process. One issue was that the
Dolby specific aspects are not very fully described anywhere in the three manuals I have
to hand. I know that the person doing the renovation in 1997 got really despondent about
the Dolby side of things.</P>


<P>These are the manuals I got hold of:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Revox A77 Service Manual</STRONG> (<STRONG>"SM"</STRONG>) as downloaded from <A HREF="https://www.reeltoreel.nl/studer/Public/Products/Revox/">https://www.reeltoreel.nl/studer/Public/Products/Revox/</A> (used to be on the official Studer FTP site,
  but no longer -- fortunately the contents were saved by Mr. Philip van der Matten and others).</LI>

 <LI>An early (probably) service manual for the Dolby aspects of the Dolby A77,
 bought on EBay and titled <STRONG>REVOX-DOLBY engl.</STRONG> We'll refer to this as
  <STRONG>"RDE"</STRONG></LI>

 <LI><STRONG>A77 Service and Maintenance Manual (2nd. Edition)</STRONG> by J. M.

<P>And here is what I did (it goes on a bit - but the Dolby B specific parts might
actually be useful to someone!):</P>

   <LI>Plug 7834 vertical signal out (on back panel) to 5370B channel 2 / freq. input.

 <UL>
   <LI>Adjust the core of discriminator transformer T201 to change 7.5ips speed (this
   thing seems to be a sort of resonant circuit that you tune to get the speed
   control). <STRONG>BUT ... there is NO WAY that you can adjust this in situ!</STRONG>
    AND if you
   try, there is a high probability of touching 150 VAC that feeds the capstan motor!
   This hurts ... The only way to do this would be to take the speed control board
   out of the machine and leave it "hanging" on its connections while adjusting.
   This reqires the removal of 3 screws attaching it to the transformer. These are
   fiddly to get at and could easily drop in to the machine. I chickened out! So,
   it is running 0.3% slow at 7.5ips and 0.1% fast at 3.75ips ...

<H1>8) DOLBY Record Processor Adjustments (SMAID 7)</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>This is where the real fun began! Some careful preparation was undertaken to try
 to make sense of where to measure the many things that needed to be measured.
 Unfortunately, when making pretty much the first adjustment (to P102), this trimpot
 literally fell apart! So, there was a pause while the record and playback processors
 had all their trimpots replaced! This was not so simple. I couldn't find the right
 size of trimpots at either RadioSpares or Maplin ... Maybe I didn't try hard enough.
 But a lot of components had recently become "no longer available" due to RoHS compliance
 requirements... The substitute trimpots were Piher enclosed verticals, and seem to be
 fine - albeit needing small wire jumpers to attach the legs at either side to the
 PCBs. Not ideal ... but it seems satisfactory.</P>

<H1>11) Input Amplifier Repair</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>There was nothing obviously wrong with the Input Amplifier module, so I started
 taking out and testing first the electrolytic capacitors, then the tantalums, then
 all the other passives ... Nothing changed. I then swapped the two PNP transistors
 over (CH1 -&gt; CH2, etc.). Nothing changed ... which was just as well, as I had no
 spares. Then I changed all the NPN transistors ... to BC548B's ... and it worked!
 I did also clean the edge connector with an eraser at the same time. So ... who
 knows which one fixed it? It seems unlikely that all 4 NPNs were bad - although I
 had previously changed one in the working channel (CH1) about 5 years ago. That
 time it was definitely the transistor that fixed a problem with horrendous
  distortion.</P>

 <P>Note the low frequency "hump" starting below 1kHz. This is almost certainly normal,
 and is a result of the test tape having been recorded with 1 full width track. When this
 is reproduced on a multi-track machine, "fringing effects" known to occur below 1kHz
 will cause low frequency "bumps", expected to be several dB up (and down) at the

<H1>17) R.F Bias Adjustment (SMAID 15, SM 6.5.1/6.5.3)</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>The infamous "setting up the bias level for the tape" ... There is a setting of the
  bias
 amplitude that will give the best combination of noise floor, distortion and frequency
 response. This is a compromise - no one bias setting will optimize all three
  simultaneously!
 We start at the lowest bias amplitude. Recordings made at this level will tend to sound
 "bright" and very noticeably distorted. Pretty horrible. As the bias is increased, the
 high frequency response will first <STRONG>increase</STRONG> (get even "brighter").
  Continuing to
 increase the bias amplitude, the high frequency response will start to fall off, and
 the distortion and noise will also start to decrease. The "amplitude peak" as the bias
 amplitude is increased can be seen on a voltmeter. The "best" bias level for a given
  tape
 brand is specified as a desired <STRONG>decrease</STRONG> in output relative to the
  level at the
 amplitude peak. This desired decrease is tape speed dependent ...</P>

 <P>In practice, the "peak" may be very close to the level obtained with minimum bias
 amplitude, so it can be quite hard to see. But using the level at minimum bias isn't
 going to be far off under those circumstances.</P>

 <P>For a given tape and tape speed, we look up the "best" bias decrease in a table
 supplied by Revox (SM Table 6.5-69 amended for more modern tapes in the "Supplement
 to the Adjustment Instructions (Chapter 6)").</P>

 <P>For Ampex 456 tape, at 7.5 ips, -6dB (x 0.5) and at 3.75 ips, it is -5dB (x 0.56).
 With other "modern tapes" (e.g. BASF / EMTEC / RMGI 468) the correct bias settings
 will be very close to the Ampex 456 levels - or so I believe.

Here are some more frequency response plots. These are from the HP3582A. This is an
FFT based spectrum analyzer (also known as a Dynamic Signal Analyzer). The input is
random noise, with the record level adjusted to -10dB on the VU meters. Please note
that these plots have a linear frequency axis.
<BR>
There are some interesting features about these plots. Puzzles even ... One thing that
had me really puzzled for a long time is that the response as shown by this method
is quite seriously dependent on the recording level. Doing this at 0VU gives a LOT more
high frequency roll off. Is this real ... or what? 
<BR>
Even weirder is that with the Filter ON at 0VU, the response is MUCH FLATTER than with
the Filter OFF (up to the frequency where the filter comes in)! I have NO EXPLANATION
for this! Unless it ties in with the level dependency. I suspect it is real, as you can
HEAR IT! There sounds to be more high frequency present in the white noise (it is white)
on playback when recording with the Filter ON that when it is OFF! Very, very unexpected.

Finally, I tried to measure the low frequency response of the A77, where I fully expected
to see "head bumps" ... quite "bouncy" low frequency response is, apparently, a well-known
feature of analog tape machines. There are some very interesting measurements of various
studio tape machines at <A href="http://www.endino.com/graphs"> this </A> web site. BUT ... I
measured nothing like this... Another puzzle, since I would expect the relatively humble
A77 to be worse than the studio machines that were measured. I think my measurement is wrong.
But why?
