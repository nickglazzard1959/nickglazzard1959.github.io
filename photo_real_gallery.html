    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Photo-realistic Renderings of Some CDC Equipment</h1>
    <br>
    To complement the main, interactive, machine room model rendered by Babylon.js, here are some
    more photo-realistic renderings of the same models made using Blender's <em>Cycles</em> path tracing
    renderer. Most of these were rendered as tests while working on the models for the main interactive
    "exhibit".
    <p>
      These have quite a few nice additional features which cannot be replicated in real time rendering,
      although a complicated technique called texture baking could give more realism to the interactive
      renders. We haven't got around to that yet, though.
    <p>
      There is quite a price to be paid in rendering time for photo-realism. Instead of many frames per second,
      these renders take several minutes to several hours on the hardware we have available.
    <p>
      Much more detailed descriptions of the devices shown can be found in the interactive machine room "exhibit".
    <p>
      It is likely more images will be added to this page in the future, so please check back occasionally.

      of necessity quite large, so there may be difficulties with low bandwidth Internet connections.
      They are between 7 MBytes and 20 MBytes each (not really so big for late 2023).

      <h2>Rooms and Buildings</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="panoview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is another type
          of "3D" viewing experience: an equirectangular projection view of the entire machine room, with
          walls, windows and an urban exterior, as delivered via the Photo Sphere Viewer web technology.
          It is much more limited than the full 3D rendered experience, but it has its advantages!
        <li> The image used for the Photo Sphere Viewer rendering can be seen
          <a href="room-1-v2-new-settings-8k-srgb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/floor-1-overview-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first floor of the NCC building</a> with
          ceilings removed (but the lights are still there -- they are the dark rectangular boxes).
          The basic floor model is stackable to build up a multi-storey building. Well, almost -- if there was a
          fire, it would be discovered that the escape ladders don't go anywhere ... a nasty surprise for the occupants! In this view, one
          of the two machine rooms on the floor is empty. You can walk from one to the other without going through
          any doors, so it is really only one room.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/floor-1-overview-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another view of the first floor</a> with
          the ceilings removed.
      </ul>

      <h2>Central Computer Equipment</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> A rear view of a <a href="Gallery/cyber-865-cpu-ds.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber 170-865 Central Computer</a>,
          showing the deadstart switch panel. This machine was introduced in 1982.
        <li> A front view of a <a href="Gallery/cyber-865-cpu.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber 170-865 Central Computer</a>,
          The "10 ton condensing unit" cooling equipment box on the left is not accurate and has been replaced in newer versions of this 3D model.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/esm-scene.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extended Semiconductor Memory cabinet</a>. We have
          found very little reference material for this and the model is based on a single photograph of the CERN computer center and
          people's recollections. Details such as the CDC logo and power switch are probably wrong. The dimensions are probably about
          right.
      </ul>

      <h2>Consoles</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> <a href="Gallery/cc545.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A CC545 Console</a>,
          as used with Cyber 170 computer systems.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/dd60a.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A DD60-A or, maybe, just DD-60 console</a> as used with
          the original CDC 6000 machines.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/dd60b.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A DD60-B console</a> as used with
          Cyber 70 series machines.
      </ul>

      <h2>Mass Storage and Networking Equipment</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> <a href="Gallery/dd844.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An 844 Disk Storage Unit</a>, which uses Type 883 removable
          disk packs. These were introduced in around 1973.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/dd885.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An 885 Disk Storage Unit</a>, which uses non-removable
          storage. These were introduced in around 1980, with a capacity equivalent to about 1 GByte. This was very large for that time,
          and CDC produced a version of these for use with IBM mainframes too.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/mt679-x4--7021-controller.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A group of four 679-7
            Magnetic Tape Transports</a> with a 7021-31 Magnetic Tape Controller.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/di-and-vt100-front.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A CDCnet DI and VT-100</a>, in a small
          generic rack. The DI provided networking facilities for Cyber mainframes from the mid-1980s onwards. Depending on the options
          fitted, it could connect a Cyber mainframe to Ethernet, or Ethernet to serial terminals or do many other things. This one
          has an MDI card connecting to a Cyber channel, an serial RS-232 card for terminal attachment and an ESCI card connecting to
          Ethernet. Having a VT-100 on top of a DI like this is probably not very realistic. Thanks to Gerard van der Grinten for images
          used to texture the DI model.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/di-and-vt100-rear.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rear view of a CDCnet DI and VT-100</a>. The
          same devices as the front view, but showing the DI interface cards. Note the magically levitating keyboard cable (not available
          in the real world).
      </ul>

      <h2>Unit Record Equipment</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> <a href="Gallery/cp415-controller.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 415 Card Punch</a>,
          with its 3446 controller in a Type B peripheral controller cabinet. These devices date back to around 1963,
          and were originally used with the CDC 3000 series machines.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/lp512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 512 Chain Printer</a>. This device was also
          originally intended for use with CDC 3000 series machines and dates from the early 1960s (perhaps 1963).
          It was obsolescent by the late 1970s when CDC offered the 580 printer.
        <li> <a href="Gallery/cr405-gallery.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 405 Card Reader</a>. Again,
          originally intended for use with CDC 3000 series machines and from around 1963. It seems generally agreed that this was
          one of the best (most reliable and fastest) card readers ever produced.
      </ul>
